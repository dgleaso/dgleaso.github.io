        My name is Daniel and I'm a Master's Student at York University.  I am working towards a Master of Science in Computer Science with a Specialization in Artificial Intelligence,
        a program officially recognized by the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

        I am excited to be working in the field of Machine Learning. I am particularly interesting in Deep Reinforcement Learning, which I am exploring in my Master's industry project. 
        I have experience working with <mark>PyTorch</mark> and <mark>TensorFlow</mark>.
        
        Once I complete my Master's degree, I hope to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning to interesting and challenging problems in industry.
