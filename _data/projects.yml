          I am working on Autonomous Parking with [General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada](https://www.gdlscanada.com/) (GDLS-C).  I am applying End-to-End and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to 
          this problem.  Bellow is a video of my results in simulation as well as a video of the robot I will be using for real-world testing.

  name: Vanilla Policy Gradient from Scratch

          I implemented the [Vanilla Policy Gradient](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/vpg.html) algorithm from scratch using [Numpy](https://numpy.org/).  I tested my 
          implementation on the [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) environment, and it is able to learn to succeed at the task within minutes.  My implementation can be 
          found [here](https://github.com/dgleaso/PolicyGradient).
