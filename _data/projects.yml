  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I am working on Autonomous Parking with [General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada](https://www.gdlscanada.com/) (GDLS-C).  I am applying End-to-End and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to 
          this problem.  Bellow are gifs of the agent running in simulation and the real world.
          More videos can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p6IFBTAmCnHIlk-kKdz1hWLcwCzXRJl2?usp=sharing).  More information will be published in my Thesis soon.
          Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!

  name: Vanilla Policy Gradient from Scratch
  description: |
          I implemented the [Vanilla Policy Gradient](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/vpg.html) algorithm from scratch using [<mark>NumPy</mark>](https://numpy.org/).  I tested my 
          implementation on the [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) environment, and it is able to learn to succeed at the task within minutes.  My implementation can be 
          found [here](https://github.com/dgleaso/PolicyGradient).
