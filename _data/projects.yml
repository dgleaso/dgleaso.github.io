          I am working on Autonomous Parking with [General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada](https://www.gdlscanada.com/) (GDLS-C).  I am applying End-to-End and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to 
  this problem.  Bellow is a video of my results in simulation as well as a video of the robot I will be using for real-world testing.
