          I am working on Autonomous Parking with [General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada](https://www.gdlscanada.com/) (GDLS-C).  I am applying End-to-End and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to 
          this problem.  Below are gifs of the agent running in simulation and the real world.
          An extended video with more details can be found [here](https://youtu.be/umz_SB_GqNA).  More information will be published in my thesis soon.
          Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!
